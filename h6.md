# h6 Mature

**Write a short story for choosing a couple of subpoints in Kybermittari \[1\]. Have imaginary persons with roles, write a story by having them speak, decide and comment on maturity. Make sure they have different expertice, e.g. also outside cybersecurity. You can choose a couple of subpoints (2d, 2e...) on any domain (critical, asset...). Add a screenshot of what they ended up with \[2\].**

## Organization and Personas

### Organization

My imaginary organization is Aurora Digital Oy, a mid-sized digital agency (30-40 employees) based in Helsinki. They design and host ecommerce sites and web applications for various Finnish companies. From the IT perspective, their area is quite critical: if the client’s business goes offline, it will cause direct revenue loss.


### Personas

I made up two personas with different roles:

-   Jari, Lead System Admin, technical senior-level expert    
-   Sara, Lead Account Manager, business representative

**Setting**: Jari and Sara meet in a glass-walled meeting room in their office in Kamppi to fill out the “Cybermeter” assessment. I describe their dialogue when they fill out the first section, “Critical”.

## Assessment

### Section 1: Identification of Critical Services and their dependencies

**Jari (J)**: Okay, the first section of Cybermeter asks about our critical services. Technically, that’s our cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines. If those break, no one’s website will work.

**Sari (S)**: From a contract perspective, the service isn’t “cloud infrastructure”. It is the “24/7 availability” we sell to clients. That’s what we get sued for if it fails. So, the critical service is called “client hosting”.

J: Fair point. The guide says we need to identify the dependencies for that service. I know the servers, but do we have a document linking specific servers to actual client SLAs?

S: We have the contracts in Salesforce, and you have the server list in… Wherever you keep it. But are they linked? Not really. If I asked you right now which server hosts the X campaign page, could you show me a document?

J: Well, I’d have to check the logs. So, for mapping processes, we are certainly not at level 4. Maybe a 2?

S: Agreed. Let’s be honest so we can justify the budget to buy that asset management tool you’ve been asking for.

Now, I show the results of their answers in the section “Identification of Critical Services and their dependencies”:

Special terms and concepts used in this section:

1.  GDPR Processing Record/Record of Processing Actvity (ROPA): mandatory internal document for controllers and processors that details all personal data processing activities \[3\].
2.  ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework of best practices in IT service management. It defines Incident Management as method for handling unexpected issues, quality drops, or outages in IT services \[4\].
3.  ISO 27001 is an international standard for establishing and maintaining an information security management system, which contains a section “Physical and Environmental Security” that aimed at protecting information assets from real-world threats by controlling access to facilities, securing equipment, and mitigating environmental risks \[5\].
4.  Software bill of materials (SBOM): formal, machine-readable inventory of all the components and their dependencies that make up software \[6\].
5.  Recovery Time Objective (RTO): maximum duration a business can tolerate a non-working system after a disruption before unacceptable consequences occur \[7\].
6.  Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is the total length of time that a process can be unavailable without causing significant damage a business \[8\].    

### Section 2: Governance of Critical Services

S: Okay, the next section asks about the Board. Owners and the CEO meet once a month… I know they talk about sales and the new office lease, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a topic of “cybersecurity governance” on the agenda unless a client complains.

J: That’s exactly the problem! I’m patching servers every week and blocking attacks, but if I need 20,000 euros for a new firewall, I have to beg the CTO, and I don’t think he takes this matter to the Board. The guide says the Board needs to “own” the policy.

S: Exactly. And look at this question about “risk appetite”. Do we actually know how much risk the Board is willing to take? Or do we just guess?

J: I think so. I just try to keep everything up. If we want a high score here, we need to stop treating security as just an IT ticket and start treating it like a business risk!

Here are their answers:


Special terms and concepts used in this section:
1.  NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides high-level guidance on managing cybersecurity risks through the core functions \[9\]. One of the framework’s goals (ID.GV-1) is dedicated to establishing an organizational information security policy \[10\].
2.  COBIT: IT governance framework developed that provides a set of principles, practices, and tools to help organizations manage and align their IT resources with business goals \[11\].
3.  ISO 31000: international standard that provides principles and guidelines for managing risk in any organization, regardless of its size or industry \[12\].

### Section 3: Minimisation of the impact of cyber security incidents on Critical Services

J: Okay, this section is about our response plan. I feel pretty good about this. When the servers crashed last November during the Black Friday rush, we got them back up in just 20 minutes.

S: True, you fixed it fast. But Jari, I didn’t know what was happening for two hours. The client was literally screaming at me on the phone, and I had no “plan” to follow. I didn't know if I should call the CEO or if you had it under control.

J: Well, I was busy fixing it. I can’t write a report while I’m coding, you know.

S: That’s exactly what this question is asking. Is the plan integrated with the business? Do I know the plan? If you get hit by a bus, does the junior dev know the plan?

J: Junior dev? No. He’d probably just cry. Okay, so maybe our “plan” is just... me, breathing.

Here are their answers:

**

Special terms and concepts used in this section:

OWASP Top Ten: a popular, regularly updated report with the most critical security risks to web applications compiled by a community of security experts \[13\].

**Sucks or succeeds. How could Kybermittari process be really useless? How could it be really useful?**  

To me, Cybermeter is a simple, free tool that helps any company check its own cybersecurity strength. It gives you an honest grade, showing exactly what you are doing well and where you have dangerous gaps to fix. 

This is super helpful because it forces you to see how much your business relies on technology you might not usually notice. Instead of just fixing computers, it helps you match your security plans with your actual business goals so everyone understands them. 

By using Cybermeter, you can come up with smart decisions to protect your company from future problems.

**What approaches, models or tools could compete with Kybermittari? Are there any benefits or downsides for those? Feel free to find your own sources.**

Some alternatives to Cybermeter that I found are frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (already mentioned above) or the C2M2 model \[14\], which actually served as the foundation for Cybermeter itself (can be found in its references). 

NIST is a global standard used worldwide, but its flaw is that it is not a maturity model, meaning it does not automatically give you a score to track your improvement. 

The C2M2 model offers a very deep assessment, but it uses a stricter calculation method that can be hard to satisfy, while Cybermeter was designed as a “lighter” version to highlight development progress more effectively. 

Another strong competitor is the ISO 27001 standard (already mentioned above). It is suitable for certification but is often too expensive and complex for smaller organizations compared to the free Cybermeter tool. 

The advantage of these international tools is their wide recognition, but they lack the specific adaptations and security of supply that Cybermeter provides, especially for SMO. At the same time, Cybermeter allows users to automatically convert results into a NIST-compatible report, giving international comparability if it’s needed.
