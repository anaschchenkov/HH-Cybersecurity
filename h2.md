## Podcast: Summary and Reflections about the Young Generation of Hackers

*TLDR. 2020s saw a massive change in hacker culture, from activism to capitalism, which is the result of the youngest hackers growing without having learned fundamental principles of digital moral and ethics, coupled with unprotected, predatory digital economies. The solution can only be the emergence of a self-aware user who implements cybersecurity and digital hygiene into his everyday life.* 

For the first part of this assignment, I have listened to the most popular episode of the podcast Darknet Diaries, called [“Dirty Coms”](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/112/). Published in 2022, it was dedicated to the “new generation” of young hackers, what their intentions and goals are. Even though I’m quite skeptical about the concept of generations as a viable social construct, this episode at least provided insights into activities and specifics of young hackers.

The talk starts with the reflection by the host, Jack Rhysider. He states that the internet created a situation where youngsters do not go through the process of passing knowledge and ethics from the older generation. It creates a generational gap: without oversight, youth becomes self-taught and experiments freely, often learning lessons in cybersecurity the hard way.

Rhysider asks himself: what defines the new generation of hackers in the 2020s?

### Money vs. Idea

The guest that goes by a name or surname “Drew”, starts with recalling stories about young hackers that aimed at using technical skills and exploits in digital economies and systems to extract money. He is sure that modern hackers are driven by possible profits in their actions, rather than some idea.

In my opinion, this is quite a stark contrast with the previous generations of hackers (if the word “generation” is at all applicable). While there were always profit-driven hackers, there were influential and visible groups, pursuing more moral goals. For instance, in the 90s these were cypherpunks that tried to protect individual privacy through digital means. As a result, they helped to formulate and execute concepts such as end-to-end encryption, decentralized networks, PGP encryption, and, later, cryptocurrency. They popularized the concept of online privacy. 

In the 2010s, it was possible for the hacktivism movement, which opposed censorship, dictatorship and centralization of resources of powers by governments and big corporations. Probably the most well-known group of hacktivists is Anonymous.

Drew’s thesis is that, being fully grown within the digital space, the latest generation of hackers saw the normalization of exploitative behavior through projects like Roblox, which was mainly unchecked by the older generation, not skilled enough for sufficient awareness.

### The Rise of Dirty Coms

As a result, most modern young hackers are involved in multiple schemes for online fraud and scam, uniting in underground communities, or “coms” for short. Dirty coms are dedicated to online crime and unethical action. These dirty coms gather up to organize criminal activities around certain schemes. Here a few of them that Drew named:

- SIM swapping and phone fraud (more on that below).
- “Cracking”: finding out passwords and credentials to personal accounts like banks using specialized software.
- Platform scams: fraud targeted at users of certain platforms (Roblox, Twitch) or those holding specific assets (NFT, crypto).
- Infosec: cybersecurity specialists that blend legitimate work with illegal, unethical and criminal actions (“double-dip”).

Each community has its own economic “ecosystem”, consisting of forums, marketplaces, hierarchies.

### SIM Swapping Breakdown and Cybercrime Ecosystem

Drew claims that the “frontier” of modern hacking is sim swapping (although, looking from 2025, I would argue it is cryptocurrencies, given the increasing amount of hacks and stolen funds in this space). SIM swapping is the process of stealing phone numbers to bypass two-factor authentication for financial accounts such as banks or crypto wallets.

A hacker starts with selecting victims, e.g. through leaked databases with credentials. Then, he finds an employee of a telecom company that a victim uses. The hacker offers him a bribe in exchange for access to the phone’s call and SMS history. With this set, he can access the accounts and drain funds from them. 

One more phenomenon of the modern hacker scene, discussed in the episode, was monetization of identities. It means that once a hacker gets access to some legitimate user’s account, he can then use it for other illegal activities, for example, phishing or chargeback fraud. These hacked accounts are also sold on special darknet marketplaces and forums. Some credentials are “logs”, meaning they can be used by other users to services, e.g. movie streaming.

Among teenagers and youngsters, there are also some specifics to hacking. As Drew said, it is popular for young hackers to conduct “doxxing” of their peers, i.e. getting access to personal information such as photos on the phone and publishing them online to “expose” the victim. According to Drew, it means that with modern hacking, driven by money or revenge rather than ideology, it is online privacy, personal data and wealth that fall under the bus. 

### Basic OPSEC Rules

To avoid hackers, Drew offers a few basic rules for young listeners in the field of operational security (OPSEC) to follow:

1. Do not screen share anything;
2. Do not link accounts to platforms such as Discord or Spotify;
3. Do not reuse passwords, i.e. have a separate password to each online service or app;
4. Do not trust people online.

### Conclusion

The participants of the podcast conclude that the profit has replaced ideology. The “dirty” coms are decentralized, global, and self-taught. Their ethics mirror startup hustle culture more than cyber-activism.

For the host Jack Rhysider, it is a generational warning: without moral guidance, a self-educated hacker youth will learn through exploitation. For now, the educational system globally does not cover this side of life. With some exceptions, on a mass scale it fails in teaching students digital ethics.

Yet, one future outcome might be the emergence of a more mature generation, where every ordinary user will implement cybersecurity principles and digital hygiene into his everyday life by default.

## Blog: Summary and Reflections about the Use of AI in Hacking

*TLDR. The use of AI for hacking marks a paradigm shift from human skill to autonomous cyber warfare. The cybersecurity will not fight AI hacking solely by people, but by AIs defending against other AIs, competing for control of digital terrain at machine speed.*

For the second part of my assignment, I decided to take the blog post from the Schneier blog called [Autonomous AI Hacking and the Future of Cybersecurity](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/autonomous-ai-hacking-and-the-future-of-cybersecurity.html), which was originally published in [CSO](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069075/autonomous-ai-hacking-and-the-future-of-cybersecurity.html).

The article opens with a statement that AI agents can now perform autonomous cyberattacks at speeds and scales that far exceed human capabilities. The author, Heather Adkins, referred to the two recent cases:

- In July 2025, Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) [reported](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025139/novel-malware-from-russias-apt28-prompts-llms-to-create-malicious-windows-commands.html) the discovery of malware of Russian origin that used an LLM to automate the process of the cyberattack on Ukraine’s governmental structures, generating both reconnaissance and data theft commands in real-time.   
- Later in August, Anthropic [reported](https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025) that they disrupted a threat actor that used Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, to automate the entire cyberattack process. AI could perform network reconnaissance, penetrate networks, and collect credentials. It was able to figure out which data to steal, how much money to extract from the victims, and how to best write extortion emails.

So, unlike traditional automation, AI-based hacking systems are becoming increasingly able to execute every step of the attack chain: reconnaissance (exploration), exploitation and exfiltration autonomously and at machine-like speed. On the other hand, there are examples of successfully tested AI-based systems for locating and removing malware at a scale.

Nevertheless, there are even some public AI-based hacking tools such as HexStrike-AI or Villager, an AI-based pentesting tool.

### Why AI Is Worse than Humans in Hacking

The author believes that AI hackers now rival or even surpass elite humans in four critical dimensions:

-   **Speed**: operations occur at faster rates.    
-   **Scale**: thousands of simultaneous attacks can be globally coordinated.    
-   **Scope**: AI agents can execute full campaigns, from discovery to extortion.    
-   **Sophistication**: AI-based models learn, adapt, and optimize autonomously.

Overall, AI threatens to change the game of everlasting competition between cybersecurity experts and hacker in favor of the former. Traditional security assumptions like having time to patch after discovery no longer work. Vulnerability research can happen during attacks, meaning defenders may face zero warning before exploitation.

Additionally, AI lowers the skill and cost barriers for entry into hacking, turning rare cyber expertise into a commodity. Average criminals can now execute sophisticated operations with minimal technical skill, powered by accessible AI models.

### Development of AI for Defense

While AI amplifies offensive potential, it can also improve the position of defenders, if done correctly. The article outlines a roadmap for AI-assisted cybersecurity evolution, divided into four phases:

1.  **Transformation of the Vulnerability Researcher**. AI automates the tedious, technical parts of vulnerability discovery, augmenting human analysts rather than replacing them. Tasks like reverse engineering, exploit triage, and patch suggestions become routine.
2.  **Emergence of “VulnOps”**.  A new discipline, Vulnerability Operations (VulnOps), could emerge, mirroring DevOps in software engineering. VulnOps experts would run AI-driven vulnerability research pipelines continuously, integrating automated discovery and mitigation into organizational workflows.
3.  **Disruption of Enterprise Software Models**. Enterprises may incorporate AI vulnerability discovery into CI/CD pipelines, evolving toward Continuous Discovery / Continuous Repair (CD/CR), where vulnerabilities are autonomously found and patched by AO tools before deployment.
4.  **The Self-Healing Network**. In the long term, AI agents could autonomously detect, patch, and validate vulnerabilities in live systems, creating self-healing networks. Organizations could independently issue patches for both internal and third-party software, potentially faster than vendors themselves.

### Conclusion

The article concludes with stating uncertainty. The nature of AI use today is dual: it can be either the weapon or a shield and remedy, depending on the user. Most likely, both hackers and cybersecurity specialists will continue developing AI tools to oppose one another. 

## Connections to the Previous Assignment

In my [previous assignment](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/h1.md), I observed the peer-reviewed paper on literature review about AI weaponization, i.e. artificial intelligence is being weaponized in cybersecurity. It mainly outlines the growing use of AI for offensive operations such as malware creation, automated phishing, data poisoning, and adaptive evasion. 

The article also emphasizes that AI lowers the technical threshold for conducting cyberattacks and enables criminals or nation-states to carry out sophisticated operations with minimal human expertise. In this view, AI represents a force multiplier for existing threats, enhancing scale, stealth, and efficiency of cyberattacks.

In contrast, the “Autonomous AI Hacking and the Future of Cybersecurity” article explores how the same technological momentum could be redirected toward defense. It proposes a counter-trajectory: AI integrated into defensive ecosystems through automated vulnerability research, continuous discovery and repair, and eventually self-healing networks. 

The two pieces balance each other out: the first diagnoses the AI weaponization problem, while the second offers adaptive, AI-driven protection models capable of operating at the same machine speed as autonomous attackers. 

Together, these articles illustrate the next stage in the cybersecurity arms race: **AI versus AI**, with the future depending on whether defensive innovation can evolve as rapidly as AI-powered offense.
