**Why would you want to use a feed reader (and RSS/Atom)? Couldn't you just browse to each website? (This task does not require tests with a computer. Find suitable sources yourself if needed.).**

In a high-dencity content space such as today’s, filtering out “noise” becomes a highly valuable feature. Although the first RSS readers appeared decades ago, their working principle is still relevant.

Probably, the first and foremost reason to use an RSS reader is that it gives you a list of news or other content from sources you select. In other words, it’s a customized news feed.

The second reason is convenience: a single RSS reader eliminates the need for manual checks across multiple sources (websites, social media, etc.).

The third reason is that an RSS reader allows you to avoid redundant content like ads on the information resources you want to read.

The final and, probably, the main reason for using RSS readers with regard to cybersecurity is higher privacy and less digital footprint \[1\]. News resources, standalone websites and social media platforms alike, earn money by collecting data on users that visit these resources (usually with cookies) for advertising purposes \[2\], even if this data is anonymized. And even if there is pretty strict EU regulation, which, for example, requires a web resource owner to get the user's consent, most do not care too much about what website and what information collects. 

Being automated software, RSS readers visit selected resources (that often give out content data in a specific format as RSS feeds) instead of a human user, thus obfuscating their digital activity and improving privacy.

**Supreme court of Finland, [case Osuuspankkikeskus port scan KKO:2003:36](https://www.finlex.fi/fi/oikeuskaytanto/korkein-oikeus/ennakkopaatokset/2003/36). Have a brief look, summarize the key thing in a couple of bullets or sentences. It's in Finnish, but Firefox has offline machine translation from Finnish to English. (This task does not require tests with a computer. This task does not require thorough legal analysis of the case.)**

The linked case is about a 17-year-old defendant (A) who performed a port scan of a financial institution’s network to locate open proxy servers. The court resolved that systematic port scanning constitutes a criminal attempt of data intrusion. A insisted that he performed a scan out of curiosity, but the court rejected this claim, finding him guilty. 

A was charged with the full amount of damage caused to the organization and its IT systems, including investigative and security-related costs. Among other things, the court refused to reduce the compensation amount due to A’s young age, taking into account the seriousness of the potential threat from the defendant’s actions (port scanning).

### Conclusion

In essence, the court case illustrates port scanning as the crime. Why? Port scanning is the process of searching for open ports (digital identifiers) in the local computer network. Ports are used by a computer to receive and send data. An open port means a computer can potentially be accessed. Cybercriminals perform port scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities of a certain individual user or organization they want to target \[3\], as port scanning can give information about the security system for checking inbound traffic and messages. Thus, port scanning is perceived as one of the first steps in cybercrime.

**Install a feed reader. Show that it can read a feed (RSS or Atom). Include a screenshot of this. You can use any feed reader you like, and you can install the feed reader in your host OS if you like. Additional tasks:**
-   ***Add the feed for Krebs. This is the one we discussed in the class. [https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/)***    
-   ***Add a feed for Schneier on Security. Find the blog, and locate the feed.***   
-   ***Find and add two more security related feeds. Explain how you found them, and why you chose them.***   
-   ***Follow security feeds for a while. What did you learn? What are the benefits and downsides of following feeds with a reader, compared to some other methods of following cyber security scene?***

For this assignment, I decided to use Feedly — it may be not open-sourced, but it’s very convenient and free for individual use (with certain yet high limitations), and I also used this service in the past.

I found and followed the following RSS feeds: [Tero Karvinen](https://terokarvinen.com/), [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/), [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/), and [Darknet](https://www.darknet.org.uk/) (the most popular blog about hacking/cybersecurity in Feedly).

In my opinion, reading blogs’ and other resources’ content in the RSS feed is highly convenient, because it eliminates most distractions such as website’s design (that is a distraction for me when it comes to reading), advertising, and other content you don’t really want to see. It gives you only information you need. I think one of the main issue for me when it comes to accessing media outlets like CNN or BBC is redundancy of visual information and distractions.

Port scan. How can criminals know what services your employer has? Disconnect your computer from the internet while doing the test (after you have installed the required software). Do the test inside your virtual machine.

-   Install nmap port scanner    
-   Disconnect from the internet. Show that 'ping 8.8.8.8' does not work.    
-   Port scan your own computer. Use "localhost" as the address.    
-   Install a daemon    
-   Port scan again    
-   Analyze and explain the results    
-   Do not scan random computers.
     
For this assignment, I’ll use a Debian VM instance installed on my Windows computer using the built-in Hyper-V virtualization platform.

I start with installing the nmap port scanner using commands/methods from previous assignments:

``sudo apt update``
``sudo apt install nmap``

After installing nmap, I disconnect the VM from the network, and check by pinging the public server:

![h4-2](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-2.png)

Now, I run the command for port scanning:

``nmap localhost``

The output is:  

![h4-3](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-3.png)

What we see:  

- ``localhost (127.0.0.1)`` - scanned target with a standard IP address
- ``Host it up`` - confirms the machine is active.
- ``Not shown`` - 999 out of 1000 scanned ports appeared to be closed.
- The sequence ``PORT-STATE-SERVICE`` - tells us the information about the open port (631/tcp), and the service (IPP). This is a standard port is for printing devices \[4\].

Next, we need to install the daemon (background-run service or process) \[5\]. One option is SSH, which sets up and listens to a certain port 22 for connecting to, and sending encrypted commands to remote devices \[6\]. 

For that, I reconnect to the network and run the command:  

``sudo apt install -y openssh-server``  

Following the assignment, the next step is to disconnect from the network again and scan the host’s ports again. After running the command, I get the following response:

![h4-4](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-4.png)

We now have 2 open ports.

What does it mean and why is it important in the context of this assignment? Installing a new service to the OS created a new constant entry point, port 22. In other words, more software means more potential entrances for a hacker attack.

In a real-world scenario, one organization can have infinite number of machines with open ports. The more software creates open ports, the more opportunities hackers have. 

Answering the assignment’s question “How can criminals know what services your employer has?” - knowing the IP address, criminals can run a simple program like nmap to see open ports, an action known as “reconaissance” (similar to a military action).

**Voluntary bonus, a bit hard: Identify a port scan against Apache on the host being scanned, e.g. in logs. Perform the test against "localhost" address and disconnect the internet while port scanning.**

The first step is to install an Apache server:

``sudo apt install apache2``

Now, I disconnect from the network and check the error log’s location:  

``ls -l /var/log/apache2/error.log``

![h4-5](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-1.png)

The next step is to clear the log:

``sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/apache2/error.log``

![h4-6](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-1.png)

Now, we can run the port scanning against the Apache server. However, the question, what to write to the command? Nmap commands include a syntax for different types of scanning, such as TCP SYN, TCP connect, USP, etc. Each type has a different flag for activation \[7\], e.g.: ``-sS``, ``-sT``, ``-sU``, ``-sY``, etc.

The one that worked for me, i.e. left records in Apache’s access log, was ``-sV``:

``sudo nmap -sV -p 80 localhost``

It resulted in a scan that requested information about server’s version:

![h4-1](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-1.png)

The scan was recorded in the access log:

``sudo cat /var/log/apache2/access.log ``

![h4-1](https://github.com/anaschchenkov/HH-Cybersecurity/blob/main/pics/h4/h4-1.png)

**Voluntary bonus, a bit hard: Modify nmap scan so that it cannot be detected by the method you found above.**

Continuing from the previous part, what helped me not getting detected, i.e. not leaving records in either of the logs after scanning, was changing the scan type to e.g. ``-sS``, the most common one because it allows for scanning TCP-based ports and is also considered “stealthy”. On the screenshot below, you can see that the scan did not leave any trace in the log:

``sudo nmap -sS -p 80 localhost``
